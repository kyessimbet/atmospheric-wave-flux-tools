Computation of quasi-geostrophic Eliassen-Palm (EP) flux and 3D Plumb fluxes by Kamilya Yessimbet. 


These scripts implement the EP flux in spherical coordinates and the 3D Plumb flux in Cartesian coordinates, providing tools to analyze wave–mean flow interactions, momentum transport, and stratosphere–troposphere coupling.


The implementations are based on the methods described in:
Yessimbet et al. (2024), https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-10893-2024


> **Note:** The scripts in this repository are slightly modified from the original versions to improve usability and output formatting.




The repository provides tools to compute flux components, their divergences, and save results in NetCDF format for further analysis or visualization.
